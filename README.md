# Color Switch Clone

## Project Description

Color Switch Clone is a basic version of the popular Color Switch game, developed as part of a task assigned from Helsinki XR Center. Navigate a ball through obstacles by matching its color with the obstacles. The game is simple yet engaging, requiring players to tap to jump and change the ball’s color to match the obstacles' colors.

**Play the Game**: [Play Color Switch Clone WebGL](https://ranajollanar.github.io/ColorSwitch/)

## How to Play

- **Tap** anywhere on the screen to make the ball jump.
- **Change Color**: Ensure the ball’s color matches the color of the obstacles to pass through them.
- **Score**: Collect stars to increase your score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the ball collides with an obstacle of a different color or falls off the screen.

## Ideas for Improvement

Here are some ideas to enhance the game and add new features:

1. **Enhance UI**
   - **Add Score to Game Over Page**: Display the final score on the game over screen.
   - **Enhance Font**: Improve the font and styling for a better user experience.
   - **Add Congrats Page**: Show a congratulatory page when the player reaches a high score or completes certain objectives.

2. **Additional Features**
   - **Add Different Levels**: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
   - **Add Hearts**: Implement a heart system where players have a limited number of lives or unlimited lives for infinite play.
   - **Scoring with PlayFab**: Integrate PlayFab for online scoring and player statistics.
   - **Resume Game**: Allow players to resume their game from where they left off.
   - **Pause Game**: Add a pause feature to allow players to pause and resume gameplay.
   - **Colorblind Mode**: Include colorblind-friendly modes.
