# Color Switch Clone

## Project Description

Color Switch Clone is a basic version of the popular Color Switch game, developed as part of a task assigned from Helsinki XR Center. Navigate a ball through obstacles by matching its color with the obstacles.

## How to Play

- **Tap** anywhere on the screen to make the ball jump.
- **Change Color**: Ensure the ball’s color matches the color of the obstacles to pass through them.
- **Score**: Collect stars to increase your score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the ball collides with an obstacle of a different color or falls off the screen.

## Ideas for Improvement

Here are some ideas to enhance the game and add new features:

1. **Enhance UI**
   - **Add Score to Game Over Page**: Display the final score on the game over screen.
   - **Enhance Font**: Improve the font and styling for a better user experience.
   - **Add Congrats Page**: Show a congratulatory page when the player reaches a high score or completes certain objectives.

2. **Additional Features**
   - **Add Different Levels**: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
   - **Add Hearts**: Implement a heart system where players have a limited number of lives or unlimited lives for infinite play.
   - **Scoring with PlayFab**: Integrate PlayFab for online scoring and player statistics.
   - **Resume Game**: Allow players to resume their game from where they left off.
   - **Pause Game**: Add a pause feature to allow players to pause and resume gameplay.
   - **Colorblind Mode**: Include colorblind-friendly modes.
